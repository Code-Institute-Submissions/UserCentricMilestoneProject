# Felipe Spoliante Litran Portfolio - User-Centric Front-End Development

This project consists of bulding a personal portfolio website with the main and ultimate goal of presenting to the public Felipe Spoliante Litran.
Therefore, the content display on the website will be split in five different parts:
- Title
- About
- Skills
- Work & Academic Background
- Contact

Basically, the idea is to successfuly introduce to potential employers, recruiters, and industry peers Felipe Spoliante Litran's profile, work history, academic background and most importantly, his abiities as a software developer.
 
## UX
 
The main goal of this website is to trigger the interest of recruiters and employers for Felipe's profile and coding skills.
Thus, in order to achieve such goal, a well-structured appealing website is required. The strategy and scope of this project is to deliver enough information in order to catch the attention of its main audience, recruiters and employers.
As for the structured, I aimed at a sing-scrolling page with five different areas. The skeletion is designed to achieve a well-distributed content without overflooding any specific section or area.

Below are a few User Stories with the following general structure: user type, action, and goal.
- As a potential employer or recruiter, I would be immediately looking for informartion conerning who Felipe Spoliante Litran is and what his programming skills are wich can be found on the "About" and "Skills" areas. Furthermore, his work history and academic background would refine my inital perception of who Felipe is. Ultimately, the "Contact" area and social media links on the "Footer" would provide me with the necessary info in order to contact him.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...


### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea


## Technologies Used

- 1. HTML
- 2. CSS
- 3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
